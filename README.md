# mag-layout-CSS
This project is aimed at improving my CSS layout skills.
Basically, I will select some specific pages from the ADWeek magazine issue JUNE 13, 2022 | VOL. LXIII NO. 12, to replicate the layout as close as possible.
The aim is to improve my knowledge about CSS and get better. 
I hope to achieve this aim by replicating a page designs from the mag everyday. 
Cheers!
