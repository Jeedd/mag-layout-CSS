                        portfolio of brands, which includes Bud Light,
                        Bud Light Seltzer and Bud Light Next, up for
                        review. Parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev
                        expects the review to conclude in the fall.
                        Wieden+Kennedy confirmed it was invited
                        to participate in the review, but declined the
                        opportunity. The agency produced several
                        memorable spots for the brand, including
                        “Dilly Dilly,” and created the Bud Knight.
                        W+K will continue to work on the Budweiser,
                        Michelob Ultra, Corona, Nütrl and AB brands.

                            ad agencies over the course of two years, including
                            DDB, mcgarrybowen, Translation and BBDO.
                            At Super Bowl 2022, Wieden+Kennedy produced
                            two spots for the company: Bud Light Next’s debut
                            and Bud Light Seltzer’s Flavortown ad featuring Guy
                            Fieri. Cannes Lions 2022 plans to honor AB InBev
                            with its Creative Marketer of the Year award.
                            According to COMvergence, Bud Light spent
                            $52 million on traditional and offline media in the
                            U.S. last year, while Bud Light Seltzer’s spending

                            21, yet already has 15.6 million
                            followers on Instagram and
                            11.4 million on YouTube.
                            She started building her online
                            career in 2017, when the aesthetic
                            of It Girls was more polished. But
                            she quickly gave up on perfection
                            to be herself—and hasn’t looked
                            back, even with brand deals.
                            “I have an inability to act,
                            which is why I’m not an actor and
                            never will be,” Chamberlain told
                            Adweek. “I have a hard time and feel
                            uncomfortable filming anything, for
                            any purpose, not as myself speaking
                            the way I would speak in real life.”
                            In an exclusive interview,
                            Chamberlain talks making brand
                            deals (her partnerships include
                            Calvin Klein and Cava) and starting
                            Chamberlain Coffee, which just
                            collaborated with beverage brand
                            Swoon. Read more at adweek.com.</p>

                                at State Farm. So to break through among the
                                under-40 crowd, the insurance agency is turning
                                to gaming. The Gamerhood Challenge invited eight
                                content creators onto a reality series streaming
                                on Twitch to vie in video game challenges while
                                dodging real-world obstacles that a State Farm
                                policy would cover. “We’re looking to try to find
                                these potential targets in authentic ways that are
                                natural to them,” Griffin added. —Rafael Canton</p>
